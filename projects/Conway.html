<p>The Game of Life is an example of a cellular automaton based on 3 rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>A live cell dies if it has less than two neighbours.</li>
<li>A live cell dies if it has more than three neighbours.</li>
<li>A dead cell becomes a live cell if it has exactly three neighbours.</li>
</ul>

Neighbours are defined in all 8 directions not just cardinals. <br>
<p>The figure shown is the Gosper glider gun, creating 'gliders'.</p>
